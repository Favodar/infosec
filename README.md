# Wannacry

## What countermeasures could be deployed or recommended to reduce the risk of this specific malware?

### - pay the ransom (obviously not optimal)
### - install the out-of-band security updates released by Microsoft for end of life products Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 8
### - kill switch hardcoded in the original software: Registering a domain name for a DNS sinkhole stopped the attack spreading as a worm
### 	- but: variants emerged, first with different kill switch, then with no killswitch alltogether
### - After-the-fact solutions: PayBreak, WannayKey
